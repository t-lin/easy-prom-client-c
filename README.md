# Easy Prometheus Client for C
A super simplified (i.e. dumbed down) C client for Prometheus (can be extended to C++ objects as well). It's essentially just an abstraction layer for the golang Prometheus client, which is the most updated (thus, it makes sense to utilize it under-the-hood).

Obviously, this method sacrifices flexibility/customizability for simplicity.

**Everything here should be considered a work in progress.**
